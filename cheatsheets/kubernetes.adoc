=== Basic Concepts

Pod::
    * Deployment-Unit in Kubernetes
    * A pod consists of one or more containers
    * Containers in a pod share network
    * Containers in a pod can share volumes
    * Each pod receives its own cluster-wide and cluster internal IP address
    * Multiple containers per pod
        * Kickstart-Pod
        * Combine auth, app, ssl and init for one service inside one pod -> Serice-Mesh

[plantuml, podService, png]
....
include::kubernetes.puml[tag=podService]
....

Kubernetes YAML-files::
    Describe the desired state of the system

`apiVersion extensions/v1beta1` is the current and production version.

==== Service

* IP and DNS for multiple pods
* Loadbalancing done by cluster
* Uses labels to find Pods

==== Deployment types

Rolling Update::
    * Update one pod after the other
    * Default variant
    * No service downtime
    * Both versions get traffic at the same time
    * consider setting:
    ** `maxUnavailable` - How many are allowed under specified
    ** `maxSurge` - How many are allowed over specified

Recreate::
    * Shutdown and restart all pods at the same time
    * Involves downtime
    * no version conflicts

Blue / Gree Deployment::
    * Startup all pods for the new version then switch all at once
    * No version conflicts
    * No downtime
    * High resource usage
    * Involves custom handling by using and switching different labels for the versions

Canary::
    * Ramp up and see if new version is failing
    * Slowly testing new versions
    * No Downtime
    * Both versions get traffic at the same time
    * Some custom handling of multiple deployments

==== Configuration

Config Maps::
    * Provide Pods with configuration data
    * from
    ** literal values
    ** files
    *** Config file
    *** Static assets
    ** directories
    * In Pods as
    ** Environment variables
    ** files
    ** directories

==== Routing with Ingress Controllers

> An Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the cluster services.

> It can be configured to give services externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL, offer name based virtual hosting, and more.

* Define rules to find a service
** Define an external access
*** hostname
*** path (url)
** Define internal service to be found
* Various implementations
** nginx
** haproxy
** Apache
** traefik
** voyager
** ...

NOTE: Implementation interpret rules differently

==== Service

* Is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them
* Usually represents a micro-service
* Different types of services possible
* Discovery by labels (selector)


===== Service Types

Define a service that can be referenced by other services or as a unit.

ClusterIP:: Inside cluster only
NodePort:: Like clusterIP, additionally maps pod-ports to the same port on each cluster node
LoadBalancer:: Creates a ClusterIP, a NodePort and a public port to make an app accessible to the public
ExternalName / ExternalIP:: Like a service, but instead of pointing to pods it just resolves to an external IP (A Record) or an external DNS name (CNAME) - Example: Database outside the cluster

==== Resilience with Service Meshs

* Can provide the missing features
* Service Proxies (e.g. Envoy) as sidecars in any Pod
* Can manage:
** Authentication
** Monitoring
** Tracing
* Also supports resilience pattern like circuit breakers
* Take a loog at httpd://istio.io[Istio]

==== Volumes / Persistance

Persistance Volume Claim:: Pod claims certain amount of persistence storage. Is mounted by kubernetes into the pod and is made available to the container.

Depending on the platform there is a persistence storage provider (Local hard drive, S3, ...)

=== Basic usage

https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/[kubectl Cheat Sheet]

.Use `kubectl` to scaffold a Kubernetes configuration file
----
$ kubectl run nginx --image nginx --dry-run -o yaml
----

.Create or update a deployment from file
----
$ kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml
----

.Edit existing deployment
----
$ kubectl edit deployment nginx
----

.Delete a single pod
----
$ kubectl delete pod pod-name-123456
----


.Open service in browser
----
$ minikube service <servicename>
----

.List services
----
$ kubectl get service
----

.Exec into container
----
$ kubectl exec -it <pod name>
----

.Create a new service
----
# Create a new service
$ kubectl expose deployment nginx --name webserver --port 80 --type NodePort
----

.Enable Minikube Ingress
----
$ minikube addons enable ingress
# Add cluster ip to /etc/hosts
# 192.168.99.100  minikube
----

.IP Address of minikube cluster
----
$ minikube ip
----

.Examine state of pod (e.g. downloading of Docker images)
----
$ kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
----

=== Rewrite URLs

The following Ingress will rewrite `http(s)://minikube/customer`` from the outside to `/` in the service.

----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: customer
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: "/"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: minikube
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /customer
        backend:
          serviceName: customer
          servicePort: 8080
----

=== Idle-Pod

Have a pod waiting idle to connect via shell and be inside the cluster to perform diagnose.
Inside this container you can access a service via the loadbalancer.

=== Application using Database

2 Pods:
1. Application
2. Database

1 Service:
1. Application Service

Scale application if required
Let the Database pod have a Persistance Volume Claim

=== Installation on Ubuntu using LXD

==== Grafana deployed via juju

.Retrieve admin password:
----
$ juju run-action --wait grafana/0 get-admin-password
----

=== Dashboard
.Retrieve admin password, IP and URL for kubernetes cluster (e.g. dashboard)
----
$ kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/config.conjure-canonical-kubern-XXX config view
----

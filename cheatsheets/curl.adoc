= cURL Cheatsheet

== Sending Form Data

When using one or more `-d` options cURL will automatically use the POST method and send a request body of type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` which is like a qureary-string.

----
$ curl -d key=value -dkey2=value2 http://localhost:8080/do-something
----

This will send the request body `key=value&key2=value2` to the server.
